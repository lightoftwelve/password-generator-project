# Secure KeyGen Password Generator

## Overview
This application allows users to generate a random password based on certain criteria that they can select. With a clean, responsive UI, users can decide the password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numberic, and special characters in the password. This app increases security by providing users with a unique, hard-to-guess password each time.

## Features
- Length Selection: Users can specify the length of their desired password, with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.
- Character Type Selection: Users can include lowercase, uppercase, numberic and special characters in their passwords. These options are presented as promps when initiating the password-generation process.
- Random Password Generation: Upon confirming their preferences, the user receives a unique, randomly generated password that meets their criteria.
- Input Validation: The app validates user inputs to ensure at least one chracter type is selected and the length is within the defined limits.
